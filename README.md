DESCRIPTION:

These are my configuration files for the Linux system monitor program Conky.
I have described the modifications and syntax updates in comments in the config files.
If you have any questions about basic Conky configuration or you have trouble using these files in a simple shell script, please let me know.
Any of you graphical wizards out there who have some tips are more than welcome to share ideas and images.
